				"My love for comics and creativity brought me to this concept. I wanted to do something out of the ordinary and, again, challenge myself with a design completely from scratch. This will continue to be updated and formatted for mobile, tablet, and desktop use. The ability to showcase who I am and what I love all in the same space is truly a wonderful feeling! Please, enjoy!

			"status":
				"This app is fully functional and currently is designed for mobile, tablet, and desktop use! The fellow hero can explore 700+ superheroes thanks to a wonderful superhero API that has been integrated into the site. Currently, you can search for your own hero by name or be given a random hero to learn about. The user will be able to also click a 'Learn More' button that will take them to a more in-depth database with more facts. Users will eventually be able to sign up and sign in to keep a list of their favorite heroes!",
			"motivation":
				"I absolutely love comics and the superhero universe! I am also always trying to remember the names, looks, and aliases of my favorite heroes and villains. I wanted to create a space to do that in while also challenging myself to work on my CSS skills. This app tested my attention to detail and I am proud of the functionality of it!",

			"motivation":
				"I wanted to challenge myself with this project because I knew it was going to be difficult to get the sounds to line up right with the glow. I used to love playing this game when I was a kid and, as a first project, I wanted to try and recreate a digital version of it.",
